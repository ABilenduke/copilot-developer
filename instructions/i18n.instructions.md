# Internationalization Delivery Checklist

Use this checklist when planning, implementing, and scaling internationalization (i18n) across applications and services.

## 1. Strategy & Stakeholders

_Docs: [W3C I18n Quick Tips](https://www.w3.org/International/getting-started/quicktips), [IETF BCP 47 Language Tags](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt)_

* [ ] Document business goals, target locales, and regulatory requirements; secure stakeholder alignment before coding.
* [ ] Establish a single owner for i18n/l10n governance and define escalation paths for translation or cultural issues.
* [ ] Budget localization lead time in roadmaps and factor translation memory/partner contracts into project plans.

## 2. Locale Data & Resource Management

_Docs: [Unicode CLDR](https://cldr.unicode.org/), [ICU Message Format Guide](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/messages/)_

* [ ] Store locale resources in structured formats (`.json`, `.po`, `.ftl`) and version them alongside source code.
* [ ] Leverage CLDR-backed libraries for plural rules, calendars, and units instead of hard-coding locale logic.
* [ ] Implement fallbacks for missing strings (e.g., `en-GB → en`) and alert on untranslated keys during CI.

## 3. Application Architecture & Tooling

_Docs: [FormatJS](https://formatjs.io/docs/), [Project Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/)_

* [ ] Abstract UI copy through i18n helpers/hooks; avoid inline literals in components and templates.
* [ ] Use message formats that support variables, pluralization, and gender (ICU, Fluent) to prevent string concatenation errors.
* [ ] Centralize locale negotiation (Accept-Language, user settings) and persist choices across sessions.

## 4. Content Authoring & Localization Workflow

_Docs: [W3C Localization Guidance](https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/authoring-html), [GitLocalize Guide](https://docs.gitlocalize.com/)_

* [ ] Provide copywriters with context (screenshots, character limits) and maintain a glossary/terminology guide.
* [ ] Automate extraction/injection of locale files (e.g., `yarn i18n:extract`) and validate keys before sending to translators.
* [ ] Track translation status per locale and surface blockers (missing approvals, vendor delays) on release boards.

## 5. Formatting, Dates & Numbers

_Docs: [MDN Intl API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl), [W3C Time & Date Formatting](https://www.w3.org/International/wiki/Date_and_time_formats)_

* [ ] Use `Intl.*` or server equivalents (ICU, moment-intl) for dates, numbers, currency, and relative time.
* [ ] Externalize measurement units and currency symbols; confirm they align with locale expectations and legal requirements.
* [ ] Support bidirectional text and script-specific typography when rendering language-specific content.

## 6. Testing & Quality Assurance

_Docs: [W3C I18n Testing](https://www.w3.org/International/testing/), [Microsoft Pseudo Localization Guidance](https://learn.microsoft.com/globalization/tools/pseudolocalization)_

* [ ] Add pseudolocalization builds to surface string length, encoding, and hard-coded layout issues early.
* [ ] Run automated tests that verify locale fallback, number/date formatting, and pluralization across representative locales.
* [ ] Coordinate linguistic QA (LQA) with native reviewers for high-impact locales before major launches.

## 7. Accessibility & Cultural Review

_Docs: [W3C WCAG Principles](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), [Inclusive Design Principles](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/)_

* [ ] Ensure localized content preserves semantic structure, ARIA attributes, and keyboard flows.
* [ ] Review imagery, colors, and idioms for cultural fit; provide locale-specific alternatives when necessary.
* [ ] Validate right-to-left layouts (mirroring, caret placement) and assistive technology behavior for those locales.

## 8. Release & Continuous Localization

_Docs: [W3C Internationalization Techniques](https://www.w3.org/International/techniques/), [Phrase Continuous Localization Guide](https://phrase.com/blog/posts/continuous-localization-guide/)_

* [ ] Sync localization sprints with engineering releases; enforce string freeze windows before GA milestones.
* [ ] Automate translation handoffs via APIs (Phrase, Lokalise, Smartling) or Git workflows to reduce manual steps.
* [ ] Track translation coverage metrics (percent localized, review status) and block releases when critical locales lag.

## 9. Performance & Observability

_Docs: [Chrome I18n Performance Tips](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/chromium-i18n), [Intl.ListFormat Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/ListFormat)_

* [ ] Lazy-load locale bundles and formatters to keep default bundles lean; prefetch common locales for known regions.
* [ ] Instrument errors for missing translations, parse failures, or locale negotiation conflicts.
* [ ] Monitor rendering metrics per locale (CLS, LCP) to catch regressions from longer text or alternate assets.

## 10. Documentation & Knowledge Sharing

_Docs: [W3C I18n Resources](https://www.w3.org/International/resources), [Unicode Localization Interoperability](https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/)_

* [ ] Maintain an i18n playbook covering tooling, workflows, glossary terms, and escalation contacts.
* [ ] Capture post-launch learnings (support tickets, QA feedback) and feed them into future localization cycles.
* [ ] Educate new engineers and translators with onboarding modules and maintain FAQs for common pitfalls.
