# Accessibility Delivery Checklist

Use this checklist when designing, implementing, and maintaining accessible user experiences.

## 1. Strategy, Policy & Compliance

_Docs: [WCAG 2.2 Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), [Accessibility Conformance Statements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/statements/), [Regional Regulations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/policies/)_

* [ ] Identify regulatory obligations (ADA, Section 508, EN 301 549, AODA) and document compliance targets (e.g., WCAG 2.2 Level AA).
* [ ] Publish or update an accessibility statement, including contact channels for users to report barriers.
* [ ] Assign cross-functional owners (design, engineering, QA, product) and define escalation paths for accessibility issues.

## 2. Inclusive Design & Content Planning

_Docs: [Inclusive Design Principles](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/), [Plain Language Guidelines](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/), [W3C Content Usability](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/uploads/content-usable/)_

* [ ] Engage diverse users (including people with disabilities) in research, personas, and usability testing.
* [ ] Write clear, concise copy with meaningful headings, descriptive link text, and culturally inclusive language.
* [ ] Plan for localization, reading level, and cognitive load; avoid relying solely on jargon or idioms.

## 3. Semantic Structure & Landmarks

_Docs: [HTML Accessibility API Mappings](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aam-1.0/), [ARIA Landmarks](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#landmark_roles), [Headings and Landmarks Smashing Guide](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/landmarks-headings-navigation-screen-readers/)_

* [ ] Use semantic HTML elements for structure (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`); avoid div/span-only layouts.
* [ ] Ensure heading levels are hierarchical and skip no levels (H1, H2, H3).
* [ ] Provide landmarks for navigation, associating them with unique labels when multiple regions exist (e.g., `aria-label="Primary navigation"`).

## 4. Keyboard & Focus Management

_Docs: [Keyboard Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?tags=keyboard), [Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#focus-visible), [Accessible Modal Dialogs](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#dialog_modal)_

* [ ] Verify that all interactive elements are reachable and operable via keyboard alone (`Tab`, `Shift+Tab`, arrow keys, space, enter).
* [ ] Maintain visible focus indicators with sufficient contrast and no forced focus outlines removal.
* [ ] Manage focus on dynamic content (dialogs, drawers, notifications) by trapping focus when necessary and returning it to a logical element on close.

## 5. Color, Contrast & Visual Design

_Docs: [Contrast Requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/#contrast-minimum), [Color Blindness Simulation](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter), [Designing Focus Indicators](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-appearance-and-focus-not-obscured.html)_

* [ ] Meet or exceed contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text/icons, 3:1 for graphical objects and focus indicators.
* [ ] Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning; provide text labels, patterns, or icons.
* [ ] Provide accessible themes (dark/light/high contrast) and respect user system settings when possible.

## 6. Forms, Controls & Feedback

_Docs: [Accessible Name and Description](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/names-and-descriptions/), [Form Design Patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#aria_ex)_

* [ ] Associate every form field with a visible label using native HTML (`<label for>` / `id`) or `aria-labelledby`.
* [ ] Provide descriptive error messages, success confirmations, and inline validation linked to the field (`aria-describedby`).
* [ ] Ensure custom widgets (tabs, accordions, combo boxes) follow WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for keyboard interaction and state management.

## 7. Multimedia & Alternatives

_Docs: [Audio/Video Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/), [Captions, Transcripts, Audio Description](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/captions/), [Live Captions Guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/live-captions/)_

* [ ] Provide synchronized captions for prerecorded video and live captions for real-time events when feasible.
* [ ] Offer transcripts for audio content and audio descriptions for essential visual information.
* [ ] Avoid autoplaying media; if autoplay is necessary, provide pause/stop controls and respect reduced motion preferences.

## 8. ARIA & Dynamic Content

_Docs: [WAI-ARIA 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/), [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/), [Live Regions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#aria_liveregion)_

* [ ] Use ARIA to enhance native elements only when semantics are unavailable; never override correct native roles.
* [ ] Keep ARIA states and properties in sync with UI behavior (e.g., `aria-expanded`, `aria-pressed`).
* [ ] Announce dynamic updates with live regions when changes occur without a page refresh (alerts, validation summaries, async results).

## 9. Motion, Animations & Responsive Behavior

_Docs: [Prefers Reduced Motion](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion), [Responsive Design Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/#reflow), [Pointer Gestures](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/pointer-gestures.html)_

* [ ] Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` by disabling or simplifying animations for users sensitive to motion.
* [ ] Ensure content reflows without loss of information or functionality at 320 CSS px width and 400% zoom.
* [ ] Provide alternatives for complex gestures (drag, multi-touch); support single pointer inputs.

## 10. Testing & Assistive Technology Verification

_Docs: [WCAG Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/), [axe DevTools](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/), [Screen Reader Testing Guide](https://webaim.org/articles/screenreader_testing/)_

* [ ] Integrate automated scans (axe-core, Pa11y, Lighthouse) into CI/CD and enforce remediation SLAs for violations.
* [ ] Conduct manual keyboard testing, screen reader checks (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack), and mobile assistive tech tests regularly.
* [ ] Maintain accessibility acceptance criteria in test plans; track issues in the same system as other defects.

## 11. Documentation, Training & Governance

_Docs: [Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/interim-repairs/roles/), [Accessibility Style Guides](https://a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide/), [Inclusive Design Training](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/)_

* [ ] Document accessibility workflows (design reviews, code reviews, QA checkpoints) and embed them in SDLC.
* [ ] Provide ongoing training for designers, developers, and QA on assistive technology and WCAG updates.
* [ ] Maintain a backlog for accessibility debt with prioritization criteria and visible ownership.

## 12. Continuous Improvement & Monitoring

_Docs: [Accessibility Monitoring Tools](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tools/list/), [A/B Testing & Personalization Considerations](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/coga/wiki/A_B_testing_and_personalization), [Inclusive Product Metrics](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/inclusive-design-metrics/)_

* [ ] Monitor production accessibility via RUM tools, error logs, and user feedback channels.
* [ ] Validate experiments, personalization, and third-party embeds for accessibility regressions before launch.
* [ ] Review checklists and standards quarterly to incorporate evolving WCAG guidance and community best practices.
